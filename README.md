# SCU_ScoreCounter

>A web application using **PHP** to get the scores of the **SCU**(Sichuan University, China) students and calculate to get the average score and GPA

####You can always try the script to find out your own scores via [chensihang.com](http://www.chensihang.com/jwc), and FYI, the front page index.php is using the front-end HTML5 framework called AmazeUI, you can try it yourself ^_^


####Thanks a lot for the simple_html_dom.php file written to parse the HTML, that's surely a lot of help
